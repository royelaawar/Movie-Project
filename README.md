### `Introduction`

Welcome to the Movie Database Website, a platform where you can explore, discover, and contribute to a growing collection of movies. Our website allows you to view detailed information about movies, watch trailers, and even add your own movies to share with the community.


### `Getting Started`

 We use json-server to serve movie data from a JSON file, and you'll also need to start the website itself. Here's how to do it:

 ### Step 1: Start the JSON Server

 Open your terminal or command prompt.

 First, install the project dependencies by running:

 [npm install]()


Next, navigate to the project directory where you have cloned or downloaded the repository.

Run the following command : [json-server --watch db.json]()

This command will start the JSON server and make the movie data available. 

### Step 2: Launch the Movie Database Website

Open a new terminal window or command prompt (while keeping the JSON server running in the previous one).

Start the website by running the following command:
[npm start]().
